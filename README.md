**Day Twenty Four - 30 days of React challenge - Redux Intro - ATM machine app

Intro to redux by building a super simple ATM app using react.js with redux.

**Concepts Explored:

- Redux basics and redux concepts for beginner
- Integrating redux with react
- The store, the reducer, dipatch and actions

Follow me as I self-learn React.js. Each day for thirty days i'll be creating a simple app and posting about it, (attempting to) explain my code, and discuss what I have learned. By the end of day 30 I hope to have a basic working knowledge of React.js and its applications!
